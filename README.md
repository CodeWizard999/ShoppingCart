# ShoppingList

This is a simple web application that allows users to create a shopping list. The user can add products and their respective quantities to the list, and also remove items from the list.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on user interactions.

# Usage
The shopping list can be accessed through the following URL: https://codewizard999.github.io/ShoppingList/ or by opening the index.html file.

When the user enters a product and its quantity and clicks the "Add" button, the input values are validated to ensure that both fields are filled. If either field is missing, an alert message is displayed. If both fields have valid input, a new row is added to the table with the product and quantity entered by the user, and a "remove" button is added to the row.

When the user clicks the "remove" button for a given row, that row is removed from the table.
